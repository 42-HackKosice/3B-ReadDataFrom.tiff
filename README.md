## Description

We tried and we created an program that add the contour of the item on the image and from the contour we create the ellipse which should contain the item.

## Protoype

We are sorry that we didn't make more, but this week was a little hectic for us and we were only starting with the Data Science so we are happy that we did what we did.
It could be better, from our side but...
The challenge was really interesting and we hope that we will learn more about data science in the future.
